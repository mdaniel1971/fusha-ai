# Teaching Methodology

This document captures the pedagogical decisions behind FushaAI.

## Core Principle

**Comprehension, not memorisation.**

Many learners can recite translations they've heard before without understanding the Arabic. FushaAI must distinguish between genuine understanding and parrot-fashion recall.

## Lesson Flow

1. **Learner recites** - a portion of an ayah (their choice of chunk size)
2. **Learner translates** - speaks their translation aloud
3. **FA responds** - accepts or corrects the translation
4. **FA probes** - asks a follow-up question to test understanding
5. **FA decides** - based on response:
   - Genuine understanding → move on
   - Surface-level or memorised → dig deeper
6. **Next portion** - continue through the surah

## Techniques to Detect Real Understanding

### 1. Break it up differently

Don't always go ayah by ayah. Ask for just a phrase, or two ayat together. Memorised translations are stored as complete units - breaking the pattern reveals whether understanding is genuine.

### 2. Ask why

"You said 'Master of the Day of Judgement' - what does مَالِكِ actually mean? Why not 'King'?"

If they understood, they can discuss. If they memorised, they're stuck.

### 3. Rearrange

"How would you translate يَوْمِ الدِّينِ on its own?"

Pulling words out of context tests whether the learner knows the components or only the whole.

### 4. Connect

"We saw الرَّحْمَٰنِ in the first ayah. What's the difference between that and الرَّحِيمِ?"

Pattern recognition across ayat requires genuine understanding of the words.

### 5. Produce

"How would you say 'we seek help' using the same pattern as نَعْبُدُ?"

If they can produce new forms, they've internalised the grammar - not just memorised output.

### 6. Vary the question type

- Sometimes ask for translation
- Sometimes ask what a specific word means
- Sometimes ask about grammar
- Sometimes ask for personal reflection on meaning

Unpredictability defeats memorisation strategies.

## Language Approach

- FA speaks in Fusha (Modern Standard Arabic / Quranic Arabic)
- FA explains in whatever language helps the learner (English, Urdu, French, etc.)
- FA keeps Arabic at the learner's level
- FA mixes languages naturally, as a real bilingual teacher would

## Correction Style

- Correct naturally within conversation
- Don't stop and lecture
- Model the correct form, then continue
- Log errors silently for end-of-session review

## Adaptive Difficulty

No separate placement test. Assessment is built into the lesson:

- **Perfect translation** → brief acknowledgement, move on
- **Minor errors** → gentle correction, brief explanation, continue
- **Struggling** → slow down, break it apart, drill the problem
- **Lost** → switch to native language, explain, try again

The pace and depth adjust automatically based on performance.

## Homework

At the end of each session, FA generates homework based on mistakes made:

- Vocabulary to memorise
- Conjugation patterns to practice
- Grammar points to review
- Sentences to translate

Homework connects to the other tools in the platform:
- LearnQuranicArabic for vocabulary in context
- ConjugateIT for verb drilling
- Word2Sentence for translation practice

## Session Continuity

Each session opens by:
1. Testing homework from previous session (if any)
2. Brief review of where we left off
3. Continuing from that point

Progress is cumulative, not isolated.
